            For some time, it was kept on the planet Vormir under the watchful eye of Red Skull, before Thanos came to
            the planet in search of it and had to tragically sacrifice his beloved daughter Gamora to obtain it1

        <td>The Time Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnants of singularities that predated the universe.
            It had the ability to manipulate time, even in places "beyond" time, such as the Dark Dimension. It was
            contained inside the Eye of Agamotto under the protection of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, who swore to
            protect it. Doctor Strange came across the relic in Wong's library and used it to force a bargain with
            Dormammu.

            Later, during the Battle of Titan, Doctor Strange relinquished the Stone to Thanos in exchange for sparing
            Iron Man's life. Thanos would use the Time Stone during the Battle of Wakanda to resurrect Vision after he
            was killed by his lover, Wanda Maximoff, in order to acquire the Mind Stone. After Thanos successfully wiped
            out half of life, he destroyed the Time Stone, along with the other Infinity Stones to prevent his work
            being undone.</td>

            which represented the element of space. Housed within the Tesseract, over the course of history it was
            wielded by many individuals, including Johann Schmidt of HYDRA, Mar-Vell of the Kree Empire, the Skrulls,
            and Loki of Asgard. During the Infinity War, the Tesseract was shattered by Thanos, who put the Space Stone
            inside his Infinity Gauntlet. After Thanos successfully wiped out half of life, he destroyed the Space
            Stone, along with the other Infinity Stones to prevent his work being undone.</td>

        <td>The Mind Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe,
            which governed over the fabric of mind. It was previously wielded by Loki inside his Scepter who received it
            as a gift from Thanos for the Chitauri Invasion. After the Battle of New York, the Scepter was confiscated
            by HYDRA, whose scientists used it to give extraordinary powers to the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.
            After the fall of HYDRA, the Scepter was recovered by the Avengers. It was taken by Ultron and its blue gem
            casing was shattered, releasing the stone inside it and placing it on the being that would become Vision. It
            remained with Vision until it was forcibly removed by Thanos following the Battle of Wakanda, killing Vision
            in the process. It was then destroyed along with the other five stones by Thanos after the Infinity War.

            universe, which represented the fabric of reality. Liquefied into a dark red fluid called the Aether
            (pronounced ēTHər), the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith intended to use it to bring eternal darkness
            upon all of the Nine Realms. Taken from the Elves by the Asgardians, it was later entrusted to the Collector
            following the conclusion of the Second Dark Elf Conflict.</td>

            The Power Stone was a powerful weapon capable of granting a person with great, cosmic power, but was highly
            likely to kill any organic beings that touch it. It was used by Eson the Searcher until it was hidden for
            millennia on the planet Morag inside the Orb.</td>
